I have previously built admin systems using Java, Spring Boot, and Nest.js, but there were always two pain points: performance waste & difficult architecture maintenance.

So I started building a Rust full-stack template â€” `rustzen-admin`, which features:

- ðŸŒŸ Backend: Axum + sqlx + RBAC permissions + JWT
- ðŸŽ¨ Frontend: Vite + React + Tailwind + Zustand
- ðŸš€ Deployment: Rust binary, easy for private deployment
