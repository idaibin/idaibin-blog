I'm originally a front-end developer, mainly working with React and TypeScript.  
Over time, I've also explored Node.js, Next.js, and Bun for building admin dashboards.  
Recently, I started building a Rust-based full-stack project called [`rustzen-admin`](https://github.com/idaibin/rustzen-admin).

This post shares my personal journey as a **front-end dev trying Rust for the first time** — from using Tauri to building a backend API with Axum, and eventually a complete admin system.

## 🧠 How It Started: From Vite to Tauri

My Rust journey started passively.

- I noticed Rust was used in performance-critical tools like Vite plugins.
- Later I discovered Tauri, a lightweight Rust-based framework for desktop apps — a modern alternative to Electron.

When I had to build a small PC tool, Electron felt too heavy. So I gave Tauri a try.  
The frontend setup was familiar, but once I saw the backend Rust code — I was completely lost.

## 🤖 Learning by Doing (with AI)

I didn't sit down and study Rust from scratch.

> ✅ I initialized a Tauri project → got stuck → asked ChatGPT → tweaked code → got stuck again → repeated until it worked.

Initially I just handled some local file storage.  
Then I decided to persist data with SQLite, introduced [`sqlx`](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), explored async functions, error handling, and eventually modularized the project.

Rust's ownership, type system, and syntax were tough at first.  
But with real use cases and help from AI, I started to understand the logic and write more idiomatic code.

## 🛠️ Why Not Java / Node / Bun?

Before diving into Rust, I took time to evaluate some common backend choices:

| Tech Stack | Pros                                         | Cons                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Java       | Stable, mature, widely used in companies     | Verbose, slower startup, heavyweight setup      |
| Node.js    | Huge ecosystem, easy to learn, fast to build | Weak typing, limited performance, heavy runtime |
| Bun        | Fast startup, lightweight toolchain          | Small community, early-stage ecosystem          |
| Rust       | 💪 Native performance, safe, easy to deploy  | Steeper learning curve                          |

I don't work on massive enterprise systems. I just wanted a backend that is **reliable, lightweight, and easy to maintain**.

> That's why I chose Rust: **build once, ship a binary, no runtime, no Docker, no surprises.**

## 🏗️ rustzen-admin: A Full-Stack Template in Rust + React

To organize my learnings, I started building `rustzen-admin`,  
a clean full-stack admin system powered by Rust and React — ideal for private deployment, lightweight dashboards, or internal tools.

### Tech Stack Overview:

- **Backend**: Rust + Axum + sqlx + RBAC permissions + JWT auth
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TailwindCSS + Zustand
- **Tooling**: dotenv for config, tracing for logs, argon2 for password hashing
- **Deployment**: Compiles into a single binary — no Docker, no Node runtime needed

---

## ✅ What's Done So Far

Here's what I've implemented so far:

- User registration, login, and JWT-based authentication
- Role-based permission system with RBAC
- Clean RESTful API structure and consistent error handling
- Modular backend architecture with service separation
- Frontend integration with TailwindUI and Zustand

The project was built completely by myself, learning as I go — using AI and community docs whenever I got stuck.

## ✨ Why I'll Continue Using Rust

Rust isn't the easiest language to learn, but the trade-offs are worth it.

What I love most about Rust:

- **Confidence in code**: The type system prevents so many bugs at compile time
- **Deploy simplicity**: One file, drop it on the server, and you're good to go
- **Memory safety**: No GC, no leaks, great performance
- **Cross-platform options**: With Tauri, I can even ship desktop versions of the same backend

As a solo developer, these qualities let me build faster, deploy with ease, and focus more on product logic — not devops or runtime debugging.

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

I'm not a backend engineer. I'm not a systems programmer.  
I'm just a front-end developer trying to build a clean, reliable admin system.

Rust didn't make things faster at first — it made me **think**. But in return, it gave me confidence, clarity, and performance.

This post isn't about being an expert — it's about **what it's like to start Rust as a real beginner**.

If you're a front-end dev curious about Rust, start small.  
Try Tauri. Build a CLI. Wrap a simple API. And maybe, like me, you'll stay.
